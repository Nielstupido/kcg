## Workflow


- Game will be split into "scenes"

- each scene has a "Scene graph" of objects, that are in the scene

- each scene is a prototype of a mechanism or type gameplay, that needs to be prototyped before intergration

- Use Scrum/Agile

- write game document

- then break up into springs/milestones, target is 2 weeks per milestone

- get as much in for the sprint/milestone as possible, cut out features if going over deadline

- do weekly milestone/task estimation

- get weekly or daily estimates of how long each task will take
