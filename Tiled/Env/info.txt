this folder, has the sprites in it

tile struct:

Go down to
func RegisterConfigTileTypes() {
so that functions read out .yaml files in
- assets/tile

and mostly tiles.yaml matters
most of it is "furniture" and tables etc.
and we need to find where its pulling sprites from , for these tiles.
at startup, all the sprites are copied from input .pngs, onto a single internal sprite sheet


assets/sprite folder has the .pngs and more yaml files


1 You load the tile Types
- it has the .png, sprites etc
- meta data etc, name, etc
2. Then we have a "map"
- which is a 2d grid of tiles
- the map has a "draw()" function
- then it just finds the tiles on the 2d grid, that are within the screen, then produces vertices/textures to GLSL shader

1. At startup there is list of yaml files, one per tile type
2. The yaml file specifies a sprite png for that tile
3. we open all the .pngs and copy the sprite data, into a master sprite sheet
4. the master sprite sheet can be huge, like 4096x4096, etc
5. then every "draw" is just a UV index coordinate into a single sprite sheet, with a shader
