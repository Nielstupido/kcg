##

All Unity Extentions must go into this folder
- anything that modifies the unity IDE
- any unity tool that modifies that interface

### FileExtentions.cs

Allows .md files to be seen in Unity Project Panel

### DesperateDevs

Note: DesperateDevs should be called "Entitas-Jenny" or "Entitas-Unity". The name is very bad.

- Entitas
- "Jenny"
- Unity tool that builds generated code files for Entitas
- entity-component-system (ECS)
