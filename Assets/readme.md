Very important. This is how the folders are layed out

Extentions
- this is where Unity extentions go (things that modify the interface)

Generated
- This is folder generated by Entitas
- We should change the settings so that it is renamed Entitas-Generated
- these are helper functions for entity component system

StreamingAssets
- this is a special Unity folder, where assets accessible by file system can be accessed
- .png and asset files go into this folder

Scenes
- This is where Unity "Scenes" go
- A scene is a specific aspect of game (like menu, ground combat, map loader test)
- A scene is a self isolated, environment to test a specific aspect of the game
